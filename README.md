# PERN STACK TODO APP

## Overview

This is a refresher course from my days at Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp. Where I wanted to build a simple full stack web application.

This Todo App allows the user full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) autonomy. Users can add to their todo list, edit/update, or delete it.
